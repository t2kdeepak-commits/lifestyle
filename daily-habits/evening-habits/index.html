        <p>
          Your evening routine is just as important as your morning routine. How you end your day
          affects the quality of your sleep, which in turn impacts how you feel the next morning.
          By establishing healthy evening habits, you create a buffer between the demands of the
          day and the rest your body needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Evening Habits for Better Sleep</h2>

        <h3>Set a Consistent Bedtime</h3>
        <p>
          Going to bed at a consistent time improves sleep quality. Try to stick to the same bedtime
          within a 30-minute window, even on weekends. This helps your body recognize when it is
          time to wind down.
        </p>

        <h3>Dim the Lights</h3>
        <p>
          Exposure to bright lights in the evening can interfere with melatonin production. About an
          hour before bed, start dimming the lights in your home to signal to your brain that it is
          time to rest.
        </p>

        <h3>Limit Screen Time</h3>
        <p>
          Blue light from phones, tablets, and computers can disrupt sleep. Avoid screens for at
          least an hour before bed. If necessary, use blue light filters or glasses in the evening.
        </p>

        <h3>Prepare for Tomorrow</h3>
        <p>
          Lay out clothes, pack your bag, or prepare lunch. This reduces morning stress and helps
          you sleep better.
        </p>

        <h3>Practice Relaxation Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          Calm your mind with reading, a warm bath, gentle stretching, or short meditation.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflect on Your Day</h3>
        <p>
          Take a few minutes to think about your day. What went well? What did you learn? What are
          you grateful for? Reflection helps you sleep with a sense of completion.
        </p>

        <h3>Avoid Heavy Meals and Caffeine</h3>
        <p>
          Finish eating 2–3 hours before bed and avoid caffeine after early afternoon. Choose light
          snacks if needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating Your Evening Routine</h2>

        <h3>Start Small</h3>
        <p>
          Begin with one or two habits, such as a consistent bedtime and a screen-free hour. Build
          gradually.
        </p>

        <h3>Make It Enjoyable</h3>
        <p>
          Include activities you enjoy and that help you unwind, like reading or listening to calming
          music.
        </p>

        <h3>Be Flexible</h3>
        <p>
          Some evenings will not go according to plan. Stay consistent over time rather than aiming
          for perfection every night.
        </p>

        <h2>The Connection Between Evening and Morning Habits</h2>
        <p>
          A good evening routine sets you up for a successful morning. Quality sleep and preparation
          in the evening create a smoother, more productive day.
