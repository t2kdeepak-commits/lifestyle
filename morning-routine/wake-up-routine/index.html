        <h1>Healthy Wake Up Routine for a Balanced and Energized Day</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">A healthy wake up routine helps you start the day with clarity, energy,
          and focus. By building simple morning habits, you can improve both
         physical and mental wellbeing while setting a positive tone for the day.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="glass-card">
         <h2>What Is a Healthy Wake Up Routine?</h2>
             <p>
                  A healthy wake up routine is a set of intentional habits practiced
                  immediately after waking up. These habits support natural energy levels,
                  reduce morning stress, and help your body transition smoothly into the day.
              </p>
               <p>
                  Instead of rushing or reacting to notifications, a structured wake up
                  routine allows you to begin the day calmly and with purpose.
              </p>
            <h2>Why a Healthy Wake Up Routine Matters</h2>
            <p>
             How you wake up affects your mood, focus, and productivity for the rest
             of the day. A consistent wake up routine improves mental clarity,
             supports better decision-making, and strengthens daily discipline.
            </p>
             <p>
                Over time, this routine becomes a foundation for healthier habits
                 throughout the day.
            </p>

        <h2>Understanding Your Sleep Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep happens in cycles of roughly 90 minutes. Waking during light sleep feels easier than waking during deep sleep. Knowing this helps explain why some mornings are smoother than others.
        </p>

        <h2>Pre-Sleep Preparation</h2>
        <h3>Set a Consistent Sleep Schedule</h3>
        <p>Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily, including weekends. Your body will adjust and waking becomes easier over time.</p>

        <h3>Create an Ideal Sleep Environment</h3>
        <p>Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Blackout curtains and white noise can improve sleep quality.</p>

        <h3>Avoid Stimulants Before Bed</h3>
        <p>Limit caffeine, alcohol, and heavy meals close to bedtime for better sleep.</p>

        <h2>Strategies for Easier Waking</h2>
        <h3>Use Light to Your Advantage</h3>
        <p>Open curtains immediately or use a sunrise alarm clock to signal your body to wake naturally.</p>

        <h3>Place Your Alarm Across the Room</h3>
        <p>Getting out of bed to turn off your alarm makes it more likely you'll stay awake.</p>

        <h3>Have a Compelling Reason to Get Up</h3>
        <p>Motivation like breakfast, a workout, or quiet time makes mornings enjoyable.</p>

        <h3>Use Cold Water</h3>
        <p>Splash cold water on your face or take a cool shower to increase alertness quickly.</p>

        <h2>The First Few Minutes After Waking</h2>
        <h3>Do Not Check Your Phone</h3>
        <p>Wait at least 30 minutes before checking emails or social media to avoid morning stress.</p>

        <h3>Hydrate Immediately</h3>
        <p>Drink water to rehydrate and kickstart your metabolism.</p>

        <h3>Move Your Body</h3>
        <p>Stretching or light movement signals your body that it’s time to be active.</p>

        <h2>Building the Wake Up Habit</h2>
        <p>Shift wake times gradually in 15-minute increments, track progress, and experiment to find what works best for you.</p>
